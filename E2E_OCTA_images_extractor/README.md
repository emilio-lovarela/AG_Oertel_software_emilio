### E2E_OCTA_Images_Extractor

This tool extracts OCTA (Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography) images from E2E files, a format used by OCT devices. It parses the directory structure of E2E files and extracts OCTA images, organizing them by patient, study, series, and depth layer such as superficial vascular complex (SVC), deep vascular complex (DVC), and avascular complex (AVC). The extracted images are saved in PNG format, enabling easy integration with other OCTA analysis tools.
