# Command Prompt or Terminal Window
If you're not familiar with using the command prompt or Terminal window, here is a basic tutorial to help you get started

#### 1. Opening the Console (Terminal)

To interact with the console (terminal/command prompt):

- **Windows:**
  - Use `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
  - Type `cmd` and press Enter.
  - **Note:** To open a terminal directly in the desired folder, just go to the folder location and type `cmd` on the address bar

- **macOS:**
  - Open Finder.
  - Navigate to `Applications` -> `Utilities`.
  - Double-click on `Terminal`.

- **Linux (Ubuntu):**
  - Use `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open the terminal.
  - - **Note:** To open a terminal directly in the desired folder, right-click on an empty space in the file manager and then select Open In Terminal


#### 2. Navigating Between Folders

Once the terminal is open, navigate between folders using basic commands:

- **Use the `cd` command to navigate between folders:**
```bash
  cd folder_name                  # Enter a folder named 'folder_name'
  cd folder_name/animals/cats     # Enter a folder named 'cats'
  cd ..                           # Move up one level
```

- **Use the `ls` or `dir` command to list files and folders in the current directory:**
```bash
  ls         # macOS and Linux
  dir        # Windows
```
