### OCTA_Filenames_Format_Adapter_for_Segmentation

This tool facilitates the conversion between output format generated by OCTA devices and the input format required by two separate tools: [OCTA Segmentation](https://github.com/aiforvision/OCTA-autosegmentation) and [OCTA Graph Feature Extraction and Analysis](https://github.com/KreitnerL/OCTA-graph-extraction). It streamlines the process of formatting filenames and organizing folders, ensuring compatibility between OCTA device output names and the input requirements of the mentioned tools.
