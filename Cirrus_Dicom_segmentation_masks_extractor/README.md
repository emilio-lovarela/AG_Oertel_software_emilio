### Cirrus_Dicom_Segmentation_Masks_Extractor

This tool is designed to **extract segmentation masks from DICOM** files generated by the **Cirrus OCT** device. It provides an interface for selecting source folders containing DICOM files and automatically extracts segmentation masks for face areas, deep vascular complex (DVC), and superficial vascular complex (SVC). The extracted masks are saved as **PNG images in a new folder with the suffix '_output'**, facilitating subsequent analysis and processing.
