### Cirrus_Dicom_Segmentation_Masks_Extractor

This tool is designed to extract segmentation masks from DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files generated by the Cirrus OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) device. It provides an interface for selecting source folders containing DICOM files and automatically extracts segmentation masks for face areas, deep vascular complex (DVC), and superficial vascular complex (SVC). The extracted masks are saved as PNG images, facilitating subsequent analysis and processing.
