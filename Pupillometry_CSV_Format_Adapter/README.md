### Pupillometry_CSV_Format_Adapter

This tool consolidates multiple CSV files containing pupillometry measurements into a single CSV file. Users can select a folder containing the CSV files, with an optional recursive search in subfolders. The tool processes each file, adding additional columns to the data, such as file ID, laterality, and measurement channel. The consolidated CSV output file is saved in a new folder with the suffix '_output'.
